        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Placement last year:</span><br>
            <span class="svar">5th place, division 5</span>

        </p>
        <br><br>


        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Name and role in the team:</span><br>
            <span class="svar">Emil Daag, manager</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
            <span class="svar">We haven't talked about goal setting yet within the team, usually done at the camp in April.
                But we absolutely must fight at the top.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
            <span class="svar">We have one who is away traveling and will miss the entire season.
                On the inside front, we have 2-3 players who are testing with us now.
                Our captain since many seasons back, has come back after years of house building and kids.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
            <span class="svar">I think Axel Vadsten will play a big role for us, he grew last season
                and is useful in many positions on the pitch. A smart and durable player who has
                leadership qualities and has a good eye for the game.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
            <span class="svar">All teams and matches have their charm at this level, I think.
                But Solberga and Sommen, who we lost both matches against last year, will be interesting to face.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="svart bold">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
            <span class="svar">Hard to say. I think we have a good chance to challenge without having a great grasp of the
                other teams.</span>
