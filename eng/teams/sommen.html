            <span id="sommen">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">With the very young squad we have, we have set ourselves the goal of
                make it through and stay on the right side of the qualifying line in the bottom of the league.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="sommen">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">The playing squad is very large. We have decided to run three senior teams this year.
                On the losing side, it is the brothers "Mo" and "Abbas" Al-Maliki who have gone to Husqvarna IF and IF
                Hallby.
                As well as last year's successful coach Alfred Palmér.
                On the new acquisition side, there are 10 players from Boxholms IF aged 16-21,
                with merits from both Boxholm's div 4 and div 6 teams in recent years..</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="sommen">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">William Fager (b.2001), as he contributes to the calmness of the game from his centre-back
                position,
                but also Noah Röjås (b.2006), who is the technical player every team needs.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="sommen">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">Of course the derbies against Torpa AIS are always interesting, but also the teams we didn't
                meet last year.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="sommen">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">Eksjö invested a little extra for this year, but I guess that Bäckseda will also challenge
                for the top.</span>
