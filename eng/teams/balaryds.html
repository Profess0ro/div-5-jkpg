        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Placement last year:</span><br>
            <span id="svar">1st place, division 6 (moved up)</span>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Name and role in the team:</span><br>
            <span id="svar">Peter Wall, teamleader<br></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">The goal is to have atleast 3 teams behind us when all games are played,
                as we are newcomers, we primarily want to establish ourselves before we look up the table.<br></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">The squad is the same as last year and we have 5 new signings and 4 who are making a
                comeback.
                there are some who have not yet decided, there may be a few more new signings before the series starts.
                But we have a significantly wider squad this year compared to last season.
                we have a young squad where most were born around 2002. We have 2 who are leaving us for Aneby
                SK.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">I believe in our collective more than individual players as we have competition in all
                positions on the pitch, so the most important thing is to keep the feeling we had last season carries
                over into this season.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">Looking forward to play against all teams. But we had a lot of duels with Torpa AIS in the
                recent years,
                so it has started to be a bit of a derby feeling. There is also a bit of love-hate towards
                Solberga.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="balaryd">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
            <span id="svar">Höreda comes from division 4, Solberga and Sommen qualified last year and Bäckseda, Örserum
                was in the top and
                both Eksjö and Ekenässjön have received reinforcements, so there are many teams challenging for the
                series victory.
                But maybe it's Solberga's turn as they qualified 2 years in a row.</span>
