      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Placement last year:</span><br>
        <span class="svar">1st place, division 6 (moved up)</span>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Name and role in the team:</span><br>
        <span class="svar">Peter Wall, teamleader<br></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">The goal is to have atleast 3 teams behind us when all games are played,
        as we are newcomers, we primarily want to establish ourselves before we look up the table.<br></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">The squad is the same as last year and we have 5 new signings and 4 who are making a
        comeback. There are also some who have not yet decided, there may be a few more new signings before the series starts.
        But we have a significantly wider squad this year compared to last season.
        we have a young squad where most were born around 2002. We have 2 who are leaving us for Aneby
        SK.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">I believe in our collective more than individual players as we have competition in all
        positions on the pitch, so the most important thing is to keep the feeling we had last season carries
        over into this season.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">Looking forward to play against all teams. But we had a lot of duels with Torpa AIS in the
        recent years, so it has started to be a bit of a derby feeling. There is also a bit of love-hate towards
        Solberga.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="balaryd bold">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">Höreda comes from division 4, Solberga and Sommen qualified last year and Bäckseda, Örserum
        was in the top and
        both Eksjö and Ekenässjön have received reinforcements, so there are many teams challenging for the
        series victory.
        But maybe it's Solberga's turn as they qualified 2 years in a row.</span>
