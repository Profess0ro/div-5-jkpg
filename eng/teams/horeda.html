        <span class="svart bold">Placement last year:</span><br>
        <span class="svar">12th place, division 4 (moved down) </span>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">Name and role in the team:</span><br>
        <span class="svar">Ingemar "Lien" Ekelund, teamleader</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">We hope to have a good season and aim to be among the top.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">We have an experienced squad of players who have played together for a long time and many of
        our own products that grown up in the area. In the last season we filled the squad with some young players
        who also comes from the area, who also took their place in the starting eleven. The squad is largely intact with
        the exception of someone who announced to scale back. We hope to expand the squad further during the season.
        Erik Nordlund is back in HGIF again.</span>

      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">We probably don't stand and fall with anyone really, but we think that the team
        in general is our strength.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">The municipal derby against Eksjö tickles of course. A derby that has not been played at
        a few years, because we have been playing in different divisions.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="svart bold">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
        <span class="svar">Eksjö is working hard and has brought in some really good top players and should
        apply as favorites. Otherwise, we think that Bäckseda will be fighting at the top. 
        Sommen may have taken another step and also they can challenge and maybe it's Solbergas year, 
        who has qualified in recent years. We hope to be able to challenge these teams ourselves. But we haven't
        that good insight at all the teams in the series because we mainly concentrating on ourselves</span>
