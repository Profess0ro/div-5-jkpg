        <span id="svart">Placement last year:</span><br>
        <span id="svar">9th place, division 5</span>

    </p>
    <br><br>
    

    <p>
        <span id="svart">Name and role in the team:</span><br>
        <span id="svar">Erik Persson, manager</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span id="svart">What are your goals for the season?</span><br>
        <span id="svar">We do not have a stated objective for the 2024 season in particular.
                        However, the club aims to establish itself as a team in division 5.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span id="svart">Any changes in the squad for this season?</span><br>
        <span id="svar">Stable, occasional expected drop. Some interesting names in, but not everything is clear.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span id="svart">Who in the team will play a big role this season and why?</span><br>
        <span id="svar">Our goalkeeper is important to the team, probably one of the best in the league (August Lindström).
                        Our strikers need to get the goalscoring going properly.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span id="svart">Which team are you looking forward to play against this season and why?</span><br>
        <span id="svar">We don't have a "Ydrederby", so the match against Sommen should probably be seen as the most interesting.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span id="svart">Which team do you think will win this year?</span><br>
        <span id="svar">Hard to say. Two outsiders that I think will place high are Eksjö and Ekenässjön.
                        Höreda will be among the top.</span>
