### I have created this website mainly for people that loves soccer around this area. So that supporters/players/managers can have a insight what the team managers thoughts are about this season.

### Header

This is a picture from a local game that a local paper put in an article.

### Navigation

<img src="pics/readme/nav.png">

1. Here I´ve put a navigation to all the teams info in a seperated navigation bar. These logos won´t change any dimension on any screensize, just create more rows on the screen. First I thought that would be a problem on mobile phones, but when I looked at the page in my phone that didn´t disturb anything and was easier to navigate. If the logos had been smaller on smaller screens it would have been harder to navigate to all team pages.
2. Here is a smaller navigation bar to pages outside the teams information.
3. On the homepage you can decide if you want to visit the page in swedish or english. 

- Almost all links is targeting the iframe, thats a method I´ve learned years ago and doesn´t need to load a whole new url. The exceptions is "standings" (opens in a new window/tab) and changing language (opens on top).

### Home
