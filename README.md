### This is a website I´ve made focusing on the pre-season for a local soccer league in the area of Jönköping.

### I have created this website mainly for people that loves soccer around this area. So that supporters/players/managers can have a insight what the team managers thoughts are about this season. 

### When reading the managers answer of my questions the supporters have more information about what the teams think of this season.

# Navigation

<img src="pics/readme/nav.png">

1. Here I´ve put a navigation to all the teams info in a seperated navigation bar. These emblems won´t change any dimension on any screensize, just create more rows on the screen. First I thought that would be a problem on mobile phones, but when I looked at the page in my phone that didn´t disturb anything and was easier to navigate. If they had been smaller on smaller screens it would have been harder to navigate to all team pages.
2. Here is a smaller navigation bar to pages outside the teams information.
3. On the homepage you can decide if you want to visit the page in swedish or english. 

- Every link is targeting the iframe, except "standings" (opens in a new window/tab) and changing language (opens on top)
